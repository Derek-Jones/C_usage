        <h3>Free Licences for Non-Commercial Projects and Evaluation</h3>
        <p>RedHill are active supporters of the free software and open source communities. As such, we provide a free
        license of Simian for non-commercial and open source use in addition to a commercial license.</p>
        <p>Simian is also available for a period of 15 days for evaluation purposes.</p>

        <p>If you feel Simian has been of benefit to your project, feel free to

        <p>However, if you intend to use Simian commercially, ie. you are not using Simian to check free software, we
        ask you to buy a license. We believe a Simian license represents excellent value for money, when compared to
        other products on the market today.</p>
