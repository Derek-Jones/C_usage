The .cnt files list the number of occurrences of different
identifiers in various open source projects, either in the
.c or the .h files.

idwordseq.awk attempts to break an identifier into subcomponents.
Underscore is treated as a separator and various patterns
are used to extract subcomponents based on likely camelcase
usage.

Example usage (assuming a Unix like command line):

awk -f idwordseq.awk < gcc-2.95.c.cnt
