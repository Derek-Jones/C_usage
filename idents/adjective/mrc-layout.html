------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MRC Psycholinguistic Database version 1, was provided as an on-line
service (see Coltheart, 1981b <mrc2.html#Coltheartb>). The service drew
on three files and several access programs. The first file was a
dictionary of words, the second and third files were sets of word
association norms from the Edinburgh Thesaurus. The service has now been
discontinued.

This second version of the MRC Psycholinguistic Database is being
provided as a computer usable resource rather than as a service. An
updated version of the dictionary file from the database (referred to
here as MRC2.DCT) is being provided for public research use along with
some programs which can be used either to access the dictionary, or as
examples on which to model programs which match users' specific needs.
This database dictionary differs from other machine usable dictionaries
in that it includes not only syntactic information but also
psychological data for the entries (see Amsler, 1984 for a review of
other machine readable dictionaries). It also differs from most
conventional dictionaries in that it does not currently attempt to
provide any semantic information. It is designed to be of use to
psycholinguists in selecting stimulus materials for testing; for use by
researchers in Artificial Intelligence as a source of information
required for natural language processing and cognitive simulation, and
for use by computer scientists who wish to use the word lists and
syntactic information in the design of text processors.

The Machine Usable Dictionary File.

The file contains 150837 words and provides information about 26
different linguistic properties, although it is not the case that
information about every property is available for every one of the
150837 words: nobody, for example, has yet collected imagery ratings on
such a large set of words, and thus only 9240 of the words possess an
imagery rating.

The dictionary file does not contain any information which is original
to it, but was assembled by merging a number of smaller databases of
limited availability:

a) the tape dictionary of Dolby, Resnikoff and MacMurray (1963) which
was created by taking all the left justified bold faced words from the
Shorter Oxford English Dictionary together with the parts of speech
given by that dictionary. In addition, words were taken from the Cornell
University tape of 20,000 commonly used words, and the parts of speech
for all these words found in the third edition of Webster's New
International Dictionary.

b) the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus (Kiss, Armstrong, Milroy and
Piper, 1973);

c) the Colerado Norms
<http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/41/2/531.refs> (Toglia and
Battig, 1978);

d) the Pavio Norms
<http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/36/3/371.abstract>
(published in 2004, these are an expansion of the norms of Pavio, Yuille
and Madigan, 1968);

e) the Gilhooly-Logie norms (Gilhooly and Logie, 1980);

f) the Kucera-Francis written frequency count (Kucera and Francis, 1967);

g) the Thorndike-Lorge written frequency count (Thorndike and Lorge,
1944; L count);

h) the phonetic transcriptions from Daniel Jones' Pronouncing Dictionary
of English Language, 12th Edition (see Guierre, 1966).

i) 2500 proper names from the Machine Usable Version of the Oxford
Advanced Learner's Dictionary (Mitton, 1986) which were added to the
published version of the dictionary and are not covered by the copyright
held by the Oxford University Press.

j) The frequency count for spoken English from the London- Lund Corpus
of English Conversation (Svartvik and Quirk, 1980; Brown, 1984).

The dictionary file currently occupies 11 Mbyte as a sequential UNIX
file. Each line of the file represents the field for one word. The
longest entry is 130 characters. The structure of each entry will be:

040320021615167000000093057530228435500000 JJ S ABLE|eI/bl|eIbl|20

The composition of the dictionary file is summarised in Table 1, which
specifies the linguistic properties described in an entry. The first
column of Table 1 indicates the columns/field in the file containing the
data. The last four properties are held in variable length fields
separated by a | character. The second column indicates the name of the
data field used elsewhere in programs and documentation. The third
column specifies the identity of the linguistic property, and the fourth
column indicates the number of words in the database for which
information about a particular linguistic property is available. The
first fourteen properties are stored in the file as numerical values.
For these properties, the occurrence count refers to the number of non
zero entries.

Table 1. The dictionary file.

Some of the properties listed in Table 1 are obvious; others require
explanation as follows:


      NLET

The distribution of entries in the WORD field by the number of letters
that they contain is shown in Table 2.

      NPHON

The distribution of entries in the WORD field by the number of phonemes
that they contain is shown in Table 3.


      NSYL

The distribution of entries in the WORD field by the number of syllables
that they contain is shown in Table 4.


      K-F-FREQ, K-F-NCATS, K-F-NSAMP

The first of these refers to a word's frequency of occurrence as given
in the norms of Kucera and Francis (1967). The maximum frequency in the
file is 69971, the minimum is 0. The meaning of K-F-NCATS and K-F-NSAMP
are defined by Kucera and Francis (1967).

Table 4. The distribution of syllable counts given by NSYL.


      T-L-FREQL

This is the frequency of occurrence as given in the L count of Thorndike
and Lorge (1942). If you plan to use this fre- quency count, you are
advised to read details about it in the Thorndike -Lorge book. For
example, the frequency value of a singular word which has a regular
plural includes the frequency of the plural form, and this is true for
other kinds of derivations too.


      BROWN-FREQ

This stands for the frequency of occurence in verbal language derived
from the London-Lund Corpus of English Conversation by Brown (1984).
There are 14529 entries for 8985 different strings in the WORD field.
The range of entries is 0 - 6833 with a mean of 35 and a standard devia-
tion of 252.


      FAM

This stands for 'printed familiarity'. The FAM values were derived from
merging three sets of familiarity norms: Pavio (unpublished), Toglia and
Battig (1978) and Gilhooly and Logie (1980). The method by which these
three sets of norms were merged is described in detail in Appendix 2 of
the MRC Psycholinguistic Database User Manual (Coltheart, 1981a). This
method may not meet with everyone's approval. FAM values lie in the
range 100 to 700 with the maximum entry of 657, a mean of 488 and a
standard deviation of 99: note that they are integer values (in the
original norms the equivalent range was 1.00 to 7.00).


      CONC

This is concreteness, and it too is derived from a merging of the Pavio,
Colerado, and Gilhooly-Logie norms: details of merging are given in
Appendix 2 of the MRC Psycholinguistic Database User Manual (Coltheart,
1981a). CONC values are in- teger, in the range 100 to 700 (min: 158;
max 670; mean 438; s.d. 120).


      IMAG

This is imageability, derived from merging the three sets of norms
referred to above, and having values in the range 100 to 700 (min 129;
max 669; mean 450; s.d. 108).


      MEANC

These are the meaningfulness ratings from the Toglia and Battig (1978),
multiplied by 100 to produce a range from 100 to 700 (min 127; max 667;
mean 415; s.d. 78).


      MEANP

This is the meaningfulness from the norms of Pavio (unpublished)
multiplied by 100 to produce a range from 100 to 700. The two sets of
meaningfulness ratings were not merged because their correlations were
low ( only + .529) and the mean values for a set of words common to the
two sets of norms were very low (see Toglia and Battig, 1978, Table 2).
These differences are due to differences in the instructions to
subjects. Thus the two sets of meaningfulness ratings are not
comparable, and so were kept seperate (min 192; max 922; mean 600; s.d.
107).


      AOA

This is age of acquisition from the norms of Gilhooly and Logie (1980),
multiplied by 100 to produce a range from 100 to 700 (min 125; max 697;
mean 405; s.d. 120).


      TQ2

When TQ2 has the value Q (40810 occurrences), this word is a
derivational varient of another word in the dictionary file (e.g.
baptist, from baptism). When TQ2 has the value 2 (4166 occurrences), the
word ends in the letter R and this R is not pronounced, except when the
next word begins with a vowel. When an entry should have both values 2
and Q for this attribute, Q is given in this field, and both values are
given in DPHON.


      WTYPE

This is syntactic category as represented in the SOED data- base
assembled by Dolby, Resnikoff and MacMurray (1963). There are ten
different syntactic categories, coded as shown in Table 5.

Syntactic Category 	Code 	occurrences
Noun 	N 	77355
Adjective 	J 	25547
Verb 	V 	30725
Adverb 	A 	4243
Preposition 	R 	230
Conjunction 	C 	108
Pronoun 	U 	134
Interjection 	I 	352
Past Participle 	P 	5939
Other 	O 	6136

Table 5. Syntactic Category codes for WTYPE.


      PDWTYPE

When you are interested in syntactic category, WTYPE can sometimes be
unsatisfactory. For example, the words FREEZE and HARASS are Nouns
according to WTYPE (as well as verbs); and indeed when these are looked
up in SOED or Webster's, they are described as nouns. If you want to
avoid such esoteric usages, PDWTYPE may be useful. It refers to the
syntactic categories given in Jones' Pronouncing Dictionary (Jones,
1963), and very unusual uses of words are not con- sidered. However
PDWTYPE uses only four categories, not ten: these four are noun (N,
22061 occurrences), verb (V, 6333 occurrences), adjective (J, 8817
occurrences) and other (O, 1179 occurrences). The mapping from WTYPE to
PDWTYPE is shown in table 6.

occurrences 	WTYPE 	PDWTYPE
3751 	A
492 	A 	O
47 	C
61 	C 	O
261 	I
91 	I 	O
16730 	J

65 	U
69 	U 	O
24392 	V
6333 	V 	V

Table 6. The mapping from WTYPE to PDWTYPE.


      ALPHSYL

If this = A, then the word is an abbreviation (130 occurrences); if S,
the word is a suffix (282 occurrences); if P, a prefix (1374
occurrences); if H, the word is hyphenated (13716 occurrences); if T, a
multi-word phrasal unit (436 occurrences). For all of these categories,
NSYL = 0. For all other words ALPHYSL is blank.


      STATUS

The 15 possible categories of STATUS are listed in Table 7; these are as
given in the Dolby database (Dolby et al., 1963) derived from the
Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, and perusal of Table 7 should make
the meanings of these categories sufficiently clear.

Status of Word 	Code 	occurrences
Dialect 	D 	2780
Alien 	F 	6003
Archaic 	A 	959
Colloquial 	Q 	405
Capital 	C 	2
Erroneous 	N 	0
Nonsense 	E 	62
Nonce Word 	W 	33
Obsolete 	O 	10549
Poetical 	P 	183
Rare 	R 	2756
Rhetorical 	H 	22
Specialised 	$ 	7731
Standard 	S 	58065
Substandard 	Z 	0

Table 7. The possible values of STATUS.


      VAR

This refers to words which have the same spelling but dif- ferent
pronunciation and syntactic classes. When the pronun- ciations differ
only in respect of stress (e.g. object, in- sult) VAR = O (212
occurrences).When the pronunciations differ phonemically (e.g. moderate,
abuse), VAR = B (1233 occurrences).


      CAP

If this = C, then the word is normally written with an ini- tial capital
letter. This can be used as an indicator of proper nouns such as the
names of people, towns, states and countries.


      IRREG

This refers to the plurality of words. Where IRREG = Z, the word is
plural (17441 occurrences), this can be used in con- junction with TQ2
to select irregular forms; where IRREG = Y, the word is a singular form
(1024 occurrences); where IRREG = B, the word is both the singular and
the plural form (151 occurences); where IRREG = N, the word has no
plural form (4407 occurences); where IRREG = P, the word is plural but
acts singular (88 occurences)


      WORD

The dictionary is ordered by the ascii sequence of these strings.
Although there are 150837 entries in the dictionary, there are only
115331 different strings. The distribution of homographs is as follows:

number of 	number of
entries 	words
1 	94225
2 	22132
3 	2967
4 	703
5 	96
6 	20
7 	5


      PHON and DPHON

The 12th edition of Daniel Jones's Pronouncing Dictionary (Jones, 1963)
was transferred to magnetic tape by Professor L. Guierre (Guierre,
1966). These are used as the basis of the phonetic transcriptions in the
PHON field. The phonetic symbols used on this tape were adjusted
following sugges- tions from Roger Mitton (see Mitton, 1986) to conform
to the U.K. Alvey standard for machine readable phonetic transcrip- tion
(Wells, 1986). The changes in phonetic symbols used from Coltheart
(1981a) made by by Quinlan (1986) include: devoiced consonants have been
folded into their voiced equivalents; Coltheart (1981a) refers to the
symbol 3, which has been ditched as no occurrence could be found; I( and
U( have been mapped into I and U respectively. The symbols currently
used in PHON field are a '/' character to denote syllable boundaries and
those presented in Table 8 with, where printable, the International
Phonetic Alphabet equivalents. The DPHON field uses these symbols
without the syllable distinguisher, but with the inclusion of the TQ2
symbols following the phonetic transcription. DPHON also includes the
following three characters: - + R. The hyphen is used to represent the
hyphen in hyphenated spellings. The 'R' character is used to represent a
final R in the first part of hyphenated words which is only pronunced if
the second part of a hyphenated word begins with a vowel. The '+' sign
is used to indicate the division between the two parts of a compound
noun written without a space (indicated by ALPHSYL = T) or hyphenation
(indicated by ALPHSYL = H).

    Errors Identified

The errors noted in this section are taken from the guidance notes on
the version of the MRC psychlinguistic database hosted by the Edinburgh
University Computer Service
<http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/facilities/help/mrc/>. They may now report
more errors than are listed here, so please check there for further details.

*Hyphens*
The longer version has up to 4 words, eg.
   UN-COME-AT-ABLE , TWO-A-PENNY , ADDLE-PATED , -ABLE , ANTE-
There are no hyphens in the shorter version.

*Apostrophes*
There are two types: the single quote *'* and the ampersand *&*, which
probably represent forward and backward quotes ' `. Not all words have
both types, eg.
   AIN&T AIN'T , AR&N&T AREN'T

*Ampersands*
They appear as apostrophes in the word and in the (D)PHON <#phon>
fields, eg.
   ANAGRAM|&n@gr&m.

*Leading diacritic*
"Ã©clair" comes at the end of the database as _ECLAIR.

*Pronunciation*
There is no difference between WARE|we@ & WHERE|we@, LOCH|l0k &
LOCK|l0k, RHYMNEY|'rImnI & RHYME|raIm
Inconsistency? LLANELLI l&'neTlI
NEPHEW|nevju

*Spaces*
There are up to two words for each entry, eg.
   DRIBS AND, AULD LANG.

*Letter count*
The NLET <#nlet> field includes spaces, diacritics and apostrophes, eg.
   WONT = 04, WON'T = 05.

*Stress*
When using dict2 <#dict2> with the -Z option, it gives an extra new line.

*Transcription*
PHON <#phon> vs. DPHON <#phon>
DPHON is supposed to be the 'edited' version of PHON but it sometimes
has an alternative pronunciation (or the same), eg.
   ABACK @b&k @b&k
   ABDUCT &bdVkt &b'dVkt
   ABROGATE &br@UgeIt '&br@geIt
Possible errors:
   SIENNA sIen@ sI'e@r@
   SCABIOUS skeIbj@s 'skeIbr@s

*Beware*
   XMAS krIsm@s 'eksm@ ETC Itsetr@ ek'setr@

*Abbreviations*
Only a few words have a full-stop in the longer version, eg.
   A.M., AM, ST NEOTS
There are no stops in the shorter version.

*Data missing*
The longer version has 150834 entries, most of which lack data.
The shorter version (135076) still has empty fields, eg.
1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 J HS DO-NOTHING|||

This list gives some idea how many entries can be used when most
complete data is included.
	134600	accurate letter count
	38900	counts
 	38300	phonetics
	2500	psychological scores
	2300	frequencies

It is unclear whether spaces in the following fields indicate "other" or
missing data.
*Type* TQ2 <#tq>
*Status* STATUS <#status>
*Variant phoneme* VAR <#var>
*Irregular plural* IRREG <#irreg>
