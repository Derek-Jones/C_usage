			NEWS file for comparator/filterator

1.0 -- 07 September 2003

Initial release.

1.1 -- 09 September 2003

* Fix silly division by zero error. Add COPYING file.
* Add -s option to filterator and make it ignore form feeds in filtered mode.

1.2 -- 10 September 2003:

* Add -C option; -w wasn't good enough to make indent-style difference
invisible by itself.

1.3 -- 12 September 2003:

* -C now implies -w.
* A new -r option strips comments.
* Code is cleaned up to pass gcc -Wall.
* filterator can now perform significance checks on shreds from shellscripts.
* There	is now a progress meter while making SCF files.
* The logic for merging ranges has been seriously speed-tuned and is 
  66% faster.  This code is O(n**2) on the number of common shreds and
  is the bottleneck on large trees.

1.4 -- 12 September 2003:

* Fix brown-paper-bag bug in reduction logic, introduced when I optimized it.
* SCF-B format now includes codebase size so we can compute percentages.
* filterator now generates a trailer containing percentage overlaps.

1.5 -- 12 September 2003:

* Fix bug in -r option.
* Capture trailing braces (as on C functions) in chunks even when they are
  ignored for comparison purposes.
* Range reports now include the line length of the file.
* Documentation improvements.

1.6 -- 15 September 2003:

* Regression-test production now in place.
* Second application of qsort trick, for significant speedups on
  trees with many common matches.
* New -v option to enable progress messages; they're off by default.
