These files contain counts for dynamic variable access in MediaBench.
Data was collected by Eylon Caspi <eylon@cs.berkeley.edu>, January 1999.
Data was extracted from raw profile output using script "CMD2".
For more info, see master's thesis:
<http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~eylon/masters/>


Each file contains 1 line per variable,
with lines sorted by number of reads per variable.
Format for each line is:

  <funcname>:<varname> <bitwidth> <numreads> <numwrites>

where:

  <funcname>  = name of C function containing the variable,
                  or empty if variable is a global
  <varname>   = name of variable
  <bitwidth>  = number of bits in variable
                  (>32 denotes variable is an array or struct)
                  (0   denotes variable is never initialized or accessed)
  <numreads>  = number of times variable was read    during execution
  <numwrites> = number of times variable was written during execution


The following table denotes which app generated which data file:
